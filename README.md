## REI:
An application «Real Estate Investment» (in short REI) enables a user to choose the desired type of property, whether it is a home, apartment, or land, for purchasing or renting from the list of properties offered by the real estate agencies or private investors. The property might be considered an investment project. The application allows the user to filter the database of real estate by parameters like price, distance from the desired location, type, number of rooms, square, etc. The home page presents the list of ads with the main photo view, with the accent on the description of the object and a smaller photo or, as an extension, with a map view, where the advertised points emerge on a map.
